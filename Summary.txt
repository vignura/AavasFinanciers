Eight Things to Know about Avvas Financiers:
============================================

    1) Background: 
    --------------
    Aavas Financiers Limited was incorporated as ‘Au Housing Finance Private Limited’ in 2011, as a private limited company. In 2013, the Company was converted into a public limited company and the name changed to ‘Au Housing Finance Limited’.
    Thereafter, in 2017, the name of the Company was changed to ‘Aavas Financiers Limited’.
        
    2) Our corporate philosophy:
    ----------------------------
    * Vision : Enriching lives of people by enabling them to achieve their dream of owning a home: Sapne Aapke, Saath Hamaara.
    * Mission: To empower and upgrade lives of low and middle-income customers by providing them accessible home loans and setting
               pioneering benchmarks in unserved and underserved markets.
    * Values : Create customer delight with focus on ease and speed. Blend traditional ethics with modern outlook to create an  
               environment of trust and transparency. Be responsive, professional and ethical in our approach towards customers.
    
    3) Focus:
    ---------
    The Company aspires to provide housing loans to customers belonging to the low and middle-income and self-employed segments in
    suburban and rural India. A large segment of India’s rural and semi-urban population is unserved or underserved by formal  financial institutions comprising customers without any credit history and we believe that this customer segment offers us significant growth opportunities and customer loyalty. We intend to focus on disbursing loans to underserved low and middle income customers primarily for the purchase and construction of single unit houses using unique appraisal methods. Aavas assesses these customers individually through differentiated means and provides customised financial solutions
    
    4) Reach:

    Capitalising on the growing demand for mortgage finance coupled with the under-penetration in India’s housing finance sector, Aavas focuses on addressing under-served and un-served housing finance needs across Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Uttarakhand and Punjab. In 2018-19, the Company spread its reach to Haryana and Uttar Pradesh and entered Punjab and Uttarakhand. We believe that these states combine a number of realities ideal for our business: rising incomes and growing aspirations among the rural and semi-urban under-served; a large number of individuals seeking to own their first homes and attractive contiguous markets.

3) I, usually say that the Bajaj Fiannce produces the Best Annual Reports, but after reading Avvas Financiers's

4) Bajaj Finance's thinking is always 2 years ahead, but this Avvas Financiers has plans for more than 2 decades!!.
5) Don't take my word, I have not changed character in the above summary. It is a Ctrl+C, Cltr+V and formatting from the annual report. If you can try and condense the above paragaphs without any loss in information, give it a try, I couldn't. This reminds me of the "Thiru Kural!!!", the most condensed, most information dense peice of litrature every writern, to my knowledge.
