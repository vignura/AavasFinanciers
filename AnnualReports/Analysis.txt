FY 2019:
========
1) To finish first, you must first finish. 
 (Note this the first Annual Report that I have seen, that starts with such an insightful quote!.)
2) India’s mortgage finance sector reported a flat 2018-19. During the same year, Aavas Financiers reported 30% disbursement growth. And growth in assets under management (AUM) by 46%. 
(Note the confidence in this statement.!)
3) And all we intend to do across our marathon journey of our existence is move from Point A to Point B.
Aavas is addressing a segment with a mortgage penetration of just "one percent". Through our sustained growth, we expect to enhance that penetration and grow sustainably year-on-year.
4) Our long-term road map: 
At Aavas Financiers, we have outlined a multi-year and multi-decade vision. We expect to grow revenues sustainably each
year across the long-term. We believe that the compounded impact of this would create substantial value.
5) Our approach: 
We believe that in a challenging business, the priority is to first finish.
This focus (as opposed to finishing first) will help us build a robust foundation. 
This robustness will be marked by a niche presence in a lending business, de-risking and investment in futuristic technologies.
6) Our discipline:
We believe that superior value-creation is the result of sustained market outperformance. 
At Aavas, this outperformance will not be derived from taking outsized bets. This outperformance will be derived from a focus to grow to the extent our Balance Sheet and priorities permit – no more, no less.

7) Eight Things to Know about Avvas Financiers.

	1) Background: 
	--------------
	Aavas Financiers Limited was incorporated as ‘Au Housing Finance Private Limited’ in 2011, as a private limited company. In 2013, the Company was converted into a public limited company and the name changed to ‘Au Housing Finance Limited’.
	Thereafter, in 2017, the name of the Company was changed to ‘Aavas Financiers Limited’.
	
	2) Our corporate philosophy:
	----------------------------
	Vision: Enriching lives of people by enabling them to achieve their dream of owning a home: Sapne Aapke, Saath Hamaara.
	Mission: To empower and upgrade lives of low and middle-income customers by providing them accessible home loans and setting
	pioneering benchmarks in unserved and underserved markets.
	Values: Create customer delight with focus on ease and speed. Blend traditional ethics with modern outlook to create an environment of trust and transparency.
	Be responsive, professional and ethical in our approach towards customers.
	
	3) Focus:
	---------
	The Company aspires to provide housing loans to customers belonging to the low and middle-income and self-employed segments in
	suburban and rural India. A large segment of India’s rural and semi-urban population is unserved or underserved by formal  financial institutions comprising customers without any credit history and we believe that this customer segment offers us significant growth opportunities and customer loyalty. We intend to focus on disbursing loans to underserved low and middle income customers primarily for the purchase and construction of single unit houses using unique appraisal methods. Aavas assesses these customers individually through differentiated means and provides customised financial solutions
	
	4) Reach:
	---------
	Capitalising on the growing demand for mortgage finance coupled with the under-
	penetration in India’s housing finance sector, Aavas focuses on addressing under-served	and un-served housing finance needs across Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Uttarakhand and Punjab. In
	2018-19, the Company spread its reach to Haryana and Uttar Pradesh and entered Punjab and Uttarakhand. We believe that these states combine a number of realities ideal for our business: rising incomes and growing aspirations among the rural and semi-urban under-served; a large number of individuals seeking to own their first homes and attractive contiguous markets.
